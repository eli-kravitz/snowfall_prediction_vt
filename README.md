This repo contains many ML methods applied to 10 years of historical weather data in Vermont in an effort to undertand future snowfall patterns. The document EliKravitz_ProjectPresentation.pptx contains the final results. This project involves the use of time series forecasting to forecast future weather patterns, and a NN classifier to map between independent features and snowfall.
